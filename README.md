This is a 2-player, 3-scene, modified version of the classic game called Spacewar. 
The classic goal of this game is to hit the the opposing player's ship and score points.
Players must score at least three points to move on to the next scene.
This game is built and run on Unity. 

Iteration/Scene #1:
I made a second ship/AI that wanders around the gamespace. 
It's similar to that of a "protect the VIP" situation. 
The player must either shoot the player ship or VIP ship.

Iteration/Scene #2:
I added a guard ship that revolves around the player's main ship. 
The player must hit this revolving one to score.

Iteration/Scene #3:
Classic rules apply but bombs are spawned at random locations on the gamespace.
Should this be hit, the other player gets a point.
